### Hi I’m Ivan

I'm a passionate and experienced Full Stack Engineer with over a decade of expertise in building dynamic and innovative web applications. I graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from University of Extremadura, and since then, I’ve been deeply immersed in the ever-evolving world of software engineering.

My journey began in 2014 as a front-end developer specializing in React, where I honed my skills in crafting responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Over the years, I transitioned into full-stack development, adopting the MERN stack as my primary focus since 2017. This extensive experience has equipped me with a deep understanding of a wide range of languages, frameworks, and tools, enabling me to seamlessly adapt to emerging technologies and deliver efficient, scalable solutions.

One of my main passions is integration of AI and web applications. I specialize in implementing AI-driven features such as intelligent chatbots, personalized recommendations, predictive analytics, and process automation within modern web applications. By leveraging AI, I aim to enhance user experiences, optimize application performance, and help businesses unlock their full potential.

Additionally, I have significant experience working with cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, where I design and deploy robust, scalable, and secure cloud-based architectures. Whether it's integrating AI-powered APIs, building end-to-end applications, or leading cross-functional teams, I bring a results-driven approach to every project.

If you’re looking for a dedicated developer who can seamlessly combine cutting-edge AI technologies with modern web development to deliver impactful solutions, let’s connect and bring your ideas to life!
